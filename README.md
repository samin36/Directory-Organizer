# Directory-Organizer
A python script that organizes files by moving them to appropriate folders in the current directory. 

To use the script, just type in: "python organizer.py" in your terminal.
As of right now, the supported filetypes are images(jpg, png, gif, ico), 
documents(word, powerpoint, text, pdf, zip), and applications(exe).
If you want to add more filetypes, in organizer.py, add another entry
in the file_to_dir dictionary with the key being the file extension
and value being the folder.
